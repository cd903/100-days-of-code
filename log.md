# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Janurary 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've been wanting to get back into python after writing a rather
simple scraping script for my work. I've had some courses on udemy for a while. Decided
to commit to this challenge with the goal of starting work on a project I've thought about for a while.

**Thoughts:**: So far this course is more about the basic principals of programming in general, so I've sped through it. I've built a quick python script to calculate weight loss over a given time.
WIll probably work on enhancing that as I continue 

**Link to work:** Included in this repo. (pyproj folder)

### Day 1: Janurary 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided I'd convert my python script from yesterday into a quick web page and hopefully host it on github pages

**Thoughts:**:Had some trouble with CDNs not loading locally. WIll probably spend some time tomorrow configuring IIS on my home machine as I have not done that yet.

### Day 2: Janurary 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the conversion. Spent some time getting IIS setup so I had a proper local environment. 

**Thoughts:**: IIS fixed my issue with the CDNs, everything working great now.

### Day 3: February 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the conversion. All validation finished and a few of the calculation functions are finished. Should be done tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**: Nothing fairly new here, trying some different approaches to how I normally handle validation to see if I like it better.

### Day 4: February 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished py to js app, setup a repo for github pages. Spend the remainer of the time determining what I'd do going forward

**Thoughts:**: Setting up github pages was really easy and is definitely a nice way to prototype different projects. Will definitely be using this feature in the future.
